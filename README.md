# ammblog-RoR

This is my first and probably last application on Ruby on Rails for my school project during RoR course at AMM VSU. I'm unlikely to maintain it, but it may help you to get started with RoR with working examples of devise usage, as well as RSpec test coverage.

Installation:

Go to console and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/s1ddok/ammblog-RoR
cd ammblog-ror
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:schema:load
bundle exec rake db:migrate
rails s
```

And then access [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on your browser. (Chrome preferably)
